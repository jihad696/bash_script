To give the files execute permissions, run the following commands:

chmod +x foreignkey_manag
chmod +x CRUD_operations
chmod +x list_db




Then, run the project with:
./list_db
This script will automatically call the other scripts as needed.

Remember to have PostgreSQL installed on your device before running the scripts.
